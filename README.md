# AND1-MySuperApp
Android application for the Android Development course at VIA University College.
Motivations:
I am an exchange student at VIA and I live in a campus just outside the city centre. The place is great but I think there is space for improvements, I want to create an App that allows the residents to easily manage the everyday-tasks and interact directly with staff. Moreover, I would like to build a platform that promotes social events and helps build a sense of community across students so that anyone can feel this place a little like home. Even for a few months.
Requirements:
- Information about office and facilities hours
- Interactive map of the campus that displays hours and use of each common room
- Notifications for important communications between staff and students
- Guide for new Residents about services like laundry and waste
- Notifying staff about broken things
- Gallery of photos 
- List of fun activities to do in Horsens
- Feedbacks to staff
- Notifications for deadlines like rent payment
